Unless you know data will be serialized with JSON or data by an object will never be exposed, it is considered good practice to override the ToString method with ojewcts becuase it allows for an easy way to inspect and thus debug object instances:
        public override string ToString()
        {
            return $"title: {title}, mins: {mins}, Rating: {Rating}";
